# Purpose: AI navigation index for SafeShell repository
# Scope: Repository structure, available resources, commands, and documentation
# Overview: Provides AI agents with a quick reference to navigate the SafeShell repository,
#     locate key files, understand available commands, and access documentation.

architecture:
  pattern: cli-daemon
  components:
    - shell_wrapper: Intercepts commands from AI tools
    - daemon: Loads plugins and evaluates policy
    - monitor: TUI for real-time visibility and approval
    - plugins: Policy logic (rm-protect, path-protect, etc.)

notes_for_agents:
  - SafeShell operates as a shell wrapper, not command shims
  - All policy logic resides in plugins - core is policy-agnostic
  - Uses Typer CLI framework with Rich for TUI
  - Build system uses justfile (not Makefile)
  - Thai-lint integrated for code quality checks
