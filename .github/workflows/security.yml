# ==============================================================================
# File: .github/workflows/security.yml
#
# Purpose: Automated security vulnerability scanning
#
# Triggers: push to main, pull_request to main, weekly schedule, workflow_dispatch
#
# Jobs:
#   - security: Run Bandit, Safety, pip-audit, and Gitleaks
#
# Tools:
#   - Bandit: Python code security scanning
#   - Safety: Dependency vulnerability checking
#   - pip-audit: OSV database scanning
#   - Gitleaks: Secret detection in git history
#
# Notes:
#   - Security scans run non-blocking (|| true) to warn without failing builds
#   - Weekly scheduled scans catch newly disclosed vulnerabilities
#   - Gitleaks requires fetch-depth: 0 for full history scanning
