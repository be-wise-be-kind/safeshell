# ==============================================================================
# File: .github/workflows/test.yml
#
# Purpose: Run unit tests on push to main, pull requests, and manual triggers
#
# Triggers: push to main, pull_request to main, workflow_dispatch
#
# Jobs:
#   - test: Run pytest unit tests with coverage on Python 3.11 and 3.12
#
# Features:
#   - Multi-Python version matrix testing (3.11, 3.12)
#   - Poetry dependency caching with version-specific keys
#   - 75% coverage threshold enforcement (TUI components are difficult to unit test)
#   - Codecov integration (Python 3.11 only)
